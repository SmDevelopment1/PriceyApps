Man makes fires to cook his food, to make bricks burns refuse, melts pitch for road construction and burns wood. All these things produce heavy smoke and this smoke pollutes air. Railway engines, power houses, mills and factories use coal and oil. Buses, trucks and cars use petrol and diesel oil. Again all these things create smoke and cause air pollution. The most serious air pollution also occurs in big cities where there are many buses, trucks and cars plying the street every day.

If it gets mixed in our body this or that way, we are sure to suffer in life. So we should take utmost care and guard against this poison. We should find out the remedy to this problem. First we should drink water from a source that contains no arsenic. Tube wells need to be tested to separate the safe from the unsafe. Safe tube wells should be painted green and unsafe ones should be painted red. More tube wells should be set up which are free from arsenic and bacteria. Surface water in pond and river is free from arsenic and so it can be used after a process of treatment. Rain water should be collected for drinking in a bacteria free container. Water should not be boiled to remove arsenic. Healthy balanced diet containing fish and vegetables should be eaten.

But the recent breaking out of bird flue has shadowed their smiling faces into gloomy ones and clouded their foreheads. It has emptied their fertile farms and turned the firms into barren lands. We have seen the heart-rending cries of the people both male and female. Their caries have pierced our hearts.

Whenever I am sick of the present, I try to get relief in the past days of my childhood. A man cannot remember everything that happened in his childhood. But certain events are stored in the sub-conscious mind. They sometime peep through mind&rsquo;s eye. I spent my childhood in my native village. When I was six, my father got me admitted into our village primary school where I spent four years. On the first day when I entered the school &ndash;compound with my father, the children were enjoying here and there. My mind was troubled with fear, but the warmth with which my classmates received me dispelled all my fears. My heart words put me at ease. The teachers were very helpful. From the very childhood I was extrovert. So I could easily cope with all types of situation. I have so many sweet memories in my early life. My playground was the bank of the mighty Teesta. In all the seasons this river had great attraction for me. Whenever I was not at home, I could be found on its bank. I was very fond of stealing mangoes, lichies, black berries and other fruits in the company of friends in summer. Sometimes we would forget to eat our midday meals. Another interesting memory is the village hat. The hat used to sit twice a weak near a river. I usually went there with some other children. But happy days did not last long. My father got an appointment in a town school and moved there immediately with all the members of the family. The leaving of my native village is the bitterest experience of my life.

So, a digital Bangladesh must guarantee efficient and effective use of modern ICT in all spheres of the society with a view to establishing good governance. In other word, making Bangladesh a digital one, we have to establish technology driven e-governance, e-commerce, e-production, e-agriculture, e-health etc. in the society emphasizing the overall development of the common people. Building strong ICT infrastructure is the pre-requisite for making Bangladesh a digital one. For this, we need to focus on the following relevant issues assessing the harsh reality that hinders our development in this context. Latest statistics reveal that Bangladesh faces a power deficit of up to 2oo mw against a demand of 5000 mw daily. It may be noted that for proper ICT development an uninterrupted power supply is a must. For the CIT development internet users of the country must be increased. In this case our position is the worst one among the south Asian countries. Form different sources, It has been learnt that, English literacy rate in Bangladesh is less than one percent. Whereas, English literacy rates in India and Pakistan are 60% 20% respectively, there is a strong correlation between English literacy and ICT development in the present context of globalization.

Our environment is polluted in two ways &ndash;air pollution and water pollution. Air is polluted in many ways. Smoke pollutes air; man makes fire to cook his food, to make bricks, melts pitch for road construction and burns wood. All these things produce heavy smoke and this smoke pollutes air. Railway engines, mills and factories and power houses use coal and oil. Buses, trucks and cars use petrol and diesel. Again all these things cause air pollution. Water is polluted in many ways. Farmers use chemical fertilizers and insecticide in their lands to grow more food. The rain and floods wash away some of the chemicals. They get mixed with canal water and river water. Mills and factories pollute water by throwing the waste materials and unsold products into the rivers and canals. Steamers, launches and even sail boats pollute water by throwing oil, food waste and human waste into the big canals and rivers. Unsanitary latrines in the countryside standing on the banks of the rivers and canals also pollute water. Thus air and water are polluted and as a result our environment gets polluted. Water pollution can be prevented in many ways. First of all we should make the people aware of the fact that water is next to air. It is called life. So chemical fertilizer and pesticide should not be allowed to mix with river water, canal water and pond water mills and factories should not throw the waste materials and unsold products into rivers and canals. Steamers, motor launches and even sail boats should not throw oil, food waste and human waste into the rivers and canals.

But certain events are stored in the sub-conscious mind. They sometime peep through mind&rsquo;s eye. Very simple and trifling things are the center of attraction for a child. When a man grows up, he may laugh at those things. My playground was the bank of the mighty Teesta. In all the seasons this river had great attraction for me. Whenever I was not at home, I could be found on its bank. I was very fond of stealing mangoes, lichies, black berries and other fruits in the company of friends in summer. Sometimes we would forget to eat our midday meals. The village mosquito was another interesting place. An old maulovi shaheb used to teach us there. It was housed in a small hut attached to the village mosque. A large number of boys and girls used to attend. We would learn lesson with deafening noise. The next worth mentioning experience was my first day at school. When I entered the school compound with my father, the children were enjoying themselves here and there. My mind was troubled with fear that I might not be quite free and easy in their midst. My heart began to beat fast when I was taken to the headmaster but his smiling face and gentle words put me at ease. I was admitted into class I. the warmth with which my classmates received me dispelled all my fears. Another interesting memory is the village hat. The hat used to sit twice a weak near a river. I usually went there with some other children. There was a bush near our house, hundreds of birds would make their nests in that bush, and sometimes I went there with other boys. Some adventurous boys caught small birds from the holes of the trees. During holidays when my mother went to sleep at noon, we went to the railway line. There I together with other children gathered pebbles. We watched how the trains passed with innumerable unknown facts. Childhood is free from worries and has infinite capacity for enjoyment.&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"97345","category_id":"53736","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nbody{ -webkit-user-select: none; -khtml-user-select: none; -moz-user-select: none;-ms-user-select: none; -o-user-select: none; user-select: none; }\n\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; color: #ff9900;\"><strong>My Class Teacher<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The name of my class teacher is Md.

It is first diagnosed in Mexico and now it has spread in many parts of the world. Swine influenza which is also called swine flu, hog flu or pig flu is an infection of a host animal by any one of several specific types of microscopic organisms called swine flu virus. The outbreak of swine flu in 2009, known as six strains are the influenza c virus and the subtypes of the influenza a virus known as H1 N1 H1N1 H3N2 and N2N3. Swine influenza is common in pigs in the Midwestern United States, Mexico, Canada, South America, Europe, Kenya, mainland china, Taiwan, japan, and other parts of eastern Asia. The origin of this new attain of virus is unknown. There are three types of influenza viruses that cause human flu; two also cause influenza in pigs, with influenza virus A being common in pigs and influenza virus c being rare. The 2009 flu outbreak is due to a new strain of subtype H1N1 not previously reported in pigs. In late April , Margaret Chan , the world health organization&rsquo;s director general, declared a public health emergency of international concern under the rules of the WHO&rsquo;s new international health regulations when the first cases of the H1N1verus were reported in the united states. Following the outbreak, on May 2, 2009, it was reported in pigs at a farm in Alberta, Canada, with a link to the outbreak in Mexico. The pigs are suspected to have caught this new strain virus from a farm worker who recently returned from Mexico, then showed symptoms of an influenza like illness. People who work with poultry and swine, especially people with intense exposures may be attacked with swine flu. In the present world swine flu has posed a great threat to the people of different countries. Bangladesh is also in a vulnerable situation. It has already taken away many human lives. Even one Bangladeshi has died of this flu in Mexico. Hence, consciousness among the people must be developed by arranging seminars, conferences, meeting on it government should take initiative in this regard.&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"97362","category_id":"53753","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nbody{ -webkit-user-select: none; -khtml-user-select: none; -moz-user-select: none;-ms-user-select: none; -o-user-select: none; user-select: none; }\n\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; color: #993300;\"><strong>The Life of a Day Labourer<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A day labourer is a person who leads his life by the sweat of his brow in various fields.

An Italian scientist named Marconi invented the wireless instrument. Many other scientists&rsquo; improved the system before it could be used as the modern radio. What it is: There is something in the air called ether which carries sound to our ears. But the waves of this ether become fainter and fainter as they travel farther. So it cannot carry the sound to a distant place. Radio is the instrument by which we can hear the sound from any part of the world. How it works: There are powerful radio stations in all bag cities in the world. In Bangladesh Dhaka, Rajshahi, Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet and Rangpur have radio transmitting sets. As soon as a sound is made the microphone catches it, and the transmitter broadcasts it in the air. The waves of ether carry it to distant places where, people, having the radio sets, can catch the sound. A medium of entertainment and instruction: The radio is a very useful instrument. It brings us the best entertainments of the world. It entertains us with songs, talks, plays, etc. the radio instructs us as well. It is a valuable medium of instruction. Over the radio we can listen to speeches of political leaders, great scientists and eminent professors. Even the ignorant masses can be educated by the radio. Businessmen get current prices, sportsmen get mews about sports and farmers get weather reports on the radio, special programmes are also arranged for school children.

Self-preservation was his only thought at that time. Gradually men realized the advantage of living together. It was necessary for their existence. Otherwise they were unable to protect themselves from the attacks of wild animals. So they formed society and learnt to live together as neighbours. Our neighbours are our companions in prosperity and adversity. We get more help from them than our close relations. So we gave our duties and responsibilities to our neighbours because they are our constant companions. Duty towards neighbours: It is our duty to treat our neighbours well. We should share in their joys and sorrows. We should stand by them and give them courage and protection in danger. We should attend upon them when they ate sick. We should help our poor neighbours with money and lessen their distress. We should feed them when they are in need of.

Indeed it is one of the seven wonders of modern science. An English scientist named Bayard invented the television in 1926. But the system had to be gradually improved by many other scientists before it could be successfully utilised by Bayard to make the modern television. How the system works: Television combines televised scenes with a take to reproducing sounds. This is done by installing a radio telephones at the two ends are thus able to hear and see each other. At the receiving station both the vision and the sound signals are made to pass through a radio frequency amplifier and frequency changer with the result that the signals devise themselves. In fact, the television is a system which employs mechanical photo, electrical and photo, electrical and wireless processes for reproducing scene, object, etc. at a distance. In many ways the method has the likeness to that of the cinema. The difference is that in the cinema pictures on a long film are reproduced while in the television an actual moving figures: i. e. the face of a speaker or of an actor is reproduced. Its importance: Television is a great improvement over the radio. Only by hearing a man&rsquo;s speaking we may not understand him fully, but we both see and hear him his speech is likely to produce greater effect on our minds. It is thus clear that the television has a very great importance. Its growing popularity shows that it can be an effective instrument of entertainment and valuable medium of instruction. In western countries, it has already been playing this role with greater and greater success. In Bangladesh a Television station has been set up at Dhaka. It is hoped that this powerful organ of entertainment and instruction will have a network throughout the country before long.&nbsp;<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Conclusion:<\/strong><\/span> Television is a popular invention of modern science.

The people we meet are not equal in nature and manner. Everybody has his personality. This may be pleasing or my not be pleasing. We accept everything normally if there is not anything most abnormal. Sometimes we meet someone who has some special qualities which make us much interested in him. In the last winter vacation I met such a man at Dinajpur. His qualities have made me much interested in him. Who he is: The most interesting man I meet in Dinajpur in Mr. Ahmed. He is a retired school teacher. He is an old widower. He is a member of the family of my friend Haque. He is the elder brother of Haque's father. There he is known as Uncle Ahmed. As a school teacher he came in contact with different classes of people and gathered wide experiences. Now he is about sixty-two years old. But he does not look so old. Infect, he always looks smart. He wears tight dress. Everybody respect and obeys him as he is the oldest man in the family. I meet this Uncle Ahmed when I went to my friend's house at Dinajpur to spend the last winter vacation. Qualities: Uncle Ahmed is satisfied with a little o anything like food and cloth. But the members of the family cannot satisfy him because he is a very fastidious man. Whenever he meets a member of his family, he asks him\/her why be\/she has done this and why he\/she has not done that. All the members of the family are afraid of his why questions. So, all the members of the family are try their best to avoid him. Uncle Ahmed cannot remain silent without asking questions. Whenever a school going boy of the family faces him, he asks him academic questions in various ways. Everybody becomes fed up with his questions. If anyone fails to answer any of his questions, he calls him worthless' or hopeless.' I was also afraid of him because he does not spare even a guest if he is a school student. Whenever he meets a visitor, he begins recounting his wide experiences. He does not try to understand that the visitor may be a very busy man. He often visits busy people to recount his experiences. He totally forgets that he told and retold them the same story several times. As a result nobody likes to listen to him. Uncle Ahmed is a lonely man.&nbsp;<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Conclusion:<\/strong><\/span> I feel very sorry for Uncle Ahmed. In fact, he is a lonely man. His wide experiences have made him very lonely. He can overcome his loneliness if he tries to write a book reflecting his wide experiences.

The day is popularly called Amar Ekushe. It is a source of inspiration and energy of the Bangladeshi. It is a protest against exploitation and injustice. This day is a government holiday. We observe the day every year in a befitting manner. Background of the day: On the 21st February in 1952, our language martyrs created a history and the day became memorable. In the then Pakistan we were majority in number. But the west Pakistanis controlled everything of the country. They understood it very clearly that their control over the majority would not last long if our language and literature were not crushed. In order to materialize their policy, they declared that Urdu would be the only state language of Pakistan. The very declaration was a crime. The opposition camp was not strongly organized in the babyhood of Pakistan. The University of Dhaka has always been politically sensitive. The brave students of the university came forward to meet the challenge. They opposed the declaration and started a movement. This movement is called the Language Movement. On the 21st February of 1952 the students of the university violated section 144 and brought out a procession protesting against the illegal and unjustified declaration. The rulers of Pakistan wanted to crush the movement at the point of the gun. But they failed to do so. Salam, Jabbar, Barkat, Rafiq, Shafiq and other unknown boys established the right of our mother tongue at the cost of their life. Not only that, Bangladeshi nationalism was born in the blood of the language martyrs. World recognition: The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared the 21st February as International Mother Language Day as a mark of respect to our language Movement of 1952. How observed \/ How the day is observed: Ekushe February is a national day of Bangladesh. But today it is an international day.

Though we have got the freedom the spirit of the freedom fight is yet to be established. Previous history of freedom fight: Bangladesh lost her independence to the British when Nawab Serajuddola was defeated in the battle of Palassey in 1757. In 1947, the British divided India into two sovereign states, India and Pakistan. Pakistan was created but the people of Bangladesh were in majority in Pakistan, They were deprived of all the powers Bangladesh was made o colony of West Pakistan. As a result the people of Bangladesh could not tolerate this and started a strong movement for their release. Background of the Liberation War: Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and some patriot of Bangladesh raised their voice of protest. In 1968, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and some other Bengalese were charged with a false case known as Agartola Conspiracy Case, but the people of Bangladesh started a strong movement against this case. Ayub Khan was compelled to release them. Then came Yahia Khan and he declared general election in 1970. The party of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman got absolute majority in the National assembly. But Yahia did not hand over the power and he stopped National Assembly. As a result, Sheikh Mujib started non-violent, non-co-operation movement. Yahia started a false dialogue with Sheikh Mujib and he began to increase the strength of army. Freedom struggle of 1971: March 25 is a black day in the history of Bangladesh. On that night the army began to attack in the unarmed people of Bangladesh. Sheik Mujib was arrested and taken to West Pakistan. The independence of Bangladesh was declared. As the liberation war started, freedom fighters took birth overnight and faced the well-trained occupying forces to Pakistan fearlessly. At Mujib Nagar the government of the people republic of Bangladesh was formed on 17th April, 1971. But the Pakistan went on committing genocide to horror of the world. Women were raped and killed. The world press believed the atrocity of the of the occupying forces exceeded all limits. Millions of innocent Bengalese fled across the border in fear of their loves. So when their crimes were full, the Pakistanis came under direct attack of the combined forces of India and Bangladesh. The 16th December: The final stage of the war took a couple of days only. On the glorious day of 16th December, the Pakistani army surrendered. Our victory day confirmed the birth of Bangladesh on the world map.&nbsp;<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Conclusion:<\/strong><\/span> Though we achieved our independence through much bloodshed, we still are not emerging as a powerful nation.

Broadly speaking, a digital society ensures an ICT driven knowledge-based society where information will be readily available on line and where all possible tasks of the government, semi-government and also private spheres will be processed using the modern technology. So, a digital Bangladesh must guarantee efficient and effective use of modern ICT in all spheres of the society with a view to establishing good governance. In other word, making Bangladesh a digital one, we have to establish technology driven e-governance, e-commerce, e-production, e-agriculture, e-health etc. in the society emphasizing the overall development of the common people. Building strong ICT infrastructure is the pre-requisite for making Bangladesh a digital one. For this, we need to focus on the following relevant issues assessing the harsh reality that hinders our development in this context. Latest statistics reveal that Bangladesh faces a power deficit of up to 2oo mw against a demand of 5000 mw daily. It may be noted that for proper ICT development an uninterrupted power supply is a must. For the CIT development internet users of the country must be increased. In this case our position is the worst one among the south Asian countries. Form different sources, It has been learnt that, English literacy rate in Bangladesh is less than one percent. Whereas, English literacy rates in India and Pakistan are 60% 20% respectively, there is a strong correlation between English literacy and ICT development in the present context of globalization. In the arena of ICT English has become the lingua-franca. Though the above accounts seem to be frustration one , these can be easily overcome within a reasonable span of time if we can establish good governance the above stated issues effective and efficiently is transparent manners. In many cases we need to reformulate our national policy (e.g. education policy. ICT policy) in accordance with the Millennium Development Goals.

The country has topped the list five times from the view point of corruption. There is none to raise voice against the galloping corruption. However there are many reasons behind this galloping corruption and the reasons are not far or seek. Thirst for power, pelf, wealth and money is the root cause of corruption. Greed, avarice and dishonesty, nepotism and favoritisms also contribute to the cause of corruption. The consequence of corruption has a far reaching negative effect on socio-economic growth and baffled the various development programmes. By practicing corruption the corrupt are growing richer and richer and the poor are becoming poorer and poorer. The widespread practice of corruption should not be allowed to go uncontrolled. The corruption people should be brought down with an iron rod. It should be checked , controlled and prevented at any cost so that the country get rid of this national malady and see the ray of hope of development and the people not involved in it can heave a sigh of relief and hope for the best and better days. They should be rewarded with due punishment. Even their wealth and money can be confiscated and they may be meted with lifelong rigorous imprisonment.

Our environment is polluted in two ways &ndash;air pollution and water pollution. Air is polluted in many ways. Smoke pollutes air; man makes fire to cook his food, to make bricks, melts pitch for road construction and burns wood. All these things produce heavy smoke and this smoke pollutes air. Railway engines, mills and factories and power houses use coal and oil. Buses, trucks and cars use petrol and diesel. Again all these things cause air pollution. Water is polluted in many ways. Farmers use chemical fertilizers and insecticide in their lands to grow more food. The rain and floods wash away some of the chemicals. They get mixed with canal water and river water. Mills and factories pollute water by throwing the waste materials and unsold products into the rivers and canals. Steamers, launches and even sail boats pollute water by throwing oil, food waste and human waste into the big canals and rivers. Unsanitary latrines in the countryside standing on the banks of the rivers and canals also pollute water. Thus air and water are polluted and as a result our environment gets polluted. Water pollution can be prevented in many ways. First of all we should make the people aware of the fact that water is next to air. It is called life. So chemical fertilizer and pesticide should not be allowed to mix with river water, canal water and pond water mills and factories should not throw the waste materials and unsold products into rivers and canals. Steamers, motor launches and even sail boats should not throw oil, food waste and human waste into the rivers and canals.

With the development of sophisticated communications media, rapid technological progress, and rapid transportation facilities, the world has come closer. We can now learn in an instant what is happening in the farthest corner of the world and travel to any country in the shortest possible time. Countries of the world are like families in a village.

The government of Bangladesh has already undertaken some important programmes in this regard. To provide primary education for at least 70 per cent of the children of sex to ten years of age by the end of 1990, the government has launched a programme called the universal primary education (UPE) project. There is another educational programme in which each primary school in a community is to be regarded as a community learning centre (CLE). The objective is to involve increasingly the parents and the members of the community in the educational activities of the school. The adults and the out-of &ndash;school youths will come to the school in the afternoon of in the evening after their vocations.

Hope you are keeping well. You know that our Annual\/SSC examination is near at hand. I am busy with my studies. I can guess that you are also busy with your studies. I am sorry to tell you that I am at present badly in need of the book, which you borrowed from me last month. How ever today I like to remind you that a few days ago you borrowed my English grammar.

Now I am writing about it.&nbsp;<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Communicative English in a newly introduced English learning method through which one can communicate with other easily. Actually it is the purpose of any language. The method has some advantages. In the communicative method at dents understanding power can be tasted more then the previous method. When a student fails to understand seen or unseen comprehension, he will be unable to answer the question that follow. A student has to fill in the gaps of cloze test from his understanding taking word from his vocabulary. In the previous course we got the letters and applications by heart. But in communicative English their situations are not common. While writing we have to add something. It increases our creative power. It encourages us to write free hand. In true sense it is the ultimate goal of any language learning. So the importance of communicative English can never be denied.&nbsp;<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">No more today. Meet when our meeting will be held again .
